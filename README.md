This folder contains a standardized workflow for the analysis of fMRI data, including essential preprocessing steps such as motion correction, spike detection, spatial smoothing, and various others.

To work and utilise scripts in this folder you will first need to clone the folder into your local machine. To do so, please follow the steps below:
```
RepositoryName="Name of the repository from github account" 
#fmri_data_analysis_pipelines in this case

cd ~/Desktop 
git clone https://gitlab.tuebingen.mpg.de/njain/fmri_data_analysis_pipelines.git
cd ~/Desktop/$RepositoryName
open fMRIAnalysis.sh
```

This will start analysing data in the terminal/ console. Please note this works on UNIX based systems such as LINUX or MAC. If you want to run in the Windows based platform please either download Linux Subsystem for Windows or either you can get Neurodesk. Please find links below:
